## hello from bikini bottom

hello! this is just a test page to ensure that my blog works properly.

this site is built with [zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator written in rust. while i wish i could say i chose zola for its [insert cool feature here], i picked it because i wanted to try something new, and i saw this cool [duckquill](https://www.getzola.org/themes/duckquill/) theme.

## other stuff

i bought this `sillycrustaceans.com` domain on a whim when i was at the cavetown concert, as i wanted to host a collaborative [immich](https://immich.app/) photo album for people to share photos and videos from it, while keeping some anonymity.

i also wanted to write some stuff (such as my takeaways from books that i've read) away from my main focus areas, so i set up this little blog.

lowkenuinely dont know what im doing but yolo :)
